# Virtual-Asisstant
I created this in late 2020, finally posted it for my portofolio.
It's a simple pyhton app that is created using tkinter GUI. you can ask questions to it, but only basic ones, and it can also solve some pretty
sophisticated mathematical problems. It takes your question and answers it by getting the answer from wikipedia or wolframalpha (depends on the question)
How to use:
- Ask your questions in the top box
- Press Enter key to show your answers
Additional Features:
- it can switch to dark mode (but not the best)

* Hope you find it useful!! :)
